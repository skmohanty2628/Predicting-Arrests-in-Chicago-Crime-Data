Crime prediction and prevention are critical for ensuring public safety and effective police administration. Chicago, one of the largest cities in the United States, these challenges are particularly complex due to the cityâ€™s diverse socio-economic landscape and varying crime rates across neighbourhood. By leveraging historical crime data, it becomes possible to predict certain outcomes, such as the likelihood of arrests in reported crime incidents. This capability is invaluable for enhancing policing strategies and shaping policies. Analysing and predicting arrests based on historical crime records from Chicago data that includes details such as crime type, location,date, time, and arrest status can be effectively approached using advanced statistical and machine learning methods. These techniques help uncover patterns and identify significant factors influencing arrests.

The target variable in this project utilizes the "Arrest" field to identify whether an arrest could be made for a given crime using the method of supervised learning. This objective is achieved by the use of models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, whose performances are evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

Objective:
Predict whether an arrest will occur for a reported crime in Chicago using machine learning.

Data Used: 
Chicago crime data, including details like crime type, location, time, and domestic involvement.

Machine Learning Models Applied:
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline model)
2. Random Forest (Improved accuracy and feature importance)
3. Neural Networks (Best performance with 79% accuracy)

Key Insights:
1. Crime type, location, and domestic cases play a major role in predicting arrests.
2. Neural Networks outperformed other models due to their ability to detect complex patterns.
3. Data balancing techniques improved model performance by handling arrest class imbalance.

Impact:
1. Helps law enforcement allocate resources efficiently.
2. Supports data-driven decision-making for crime prevention.
3. Enhances public safety by predicting high-risk situations.
   
This project highlights how AI and predictive analytics can improve policing strategies and community safety.
